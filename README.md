# Overview

This project uses classification to model and predict the state of water wells in the African nation of Tanzania.  The purpose for the predictive model is to assist the goverment officials at **The Tanzania Commission for Water** to find water wells that are **not functioning at all** or that are **functioning but require repair** for the agency to contract out the work that is needed to bring these water wells up to functioning level.  

I have used a curated data set found on **DrivenData.com** to run my predictive models against.  Prior to cleaning the data, this dataset contained over 60k rows along with 30+ features.  
# Business Understanding
**The Tanzania Commission for Water** is a federal agency in the African State of Tanzania primarily responsible for the cleaniness and safety of the water that is supplied to the general public and residents of Tanzania.  

Currently, Tanzania lacks the ability to provide a safe source of drinking water to over **50%** of their population.  Although, there have been many attempts to correct this issue over the years, so far all of those attempts have fallen short of their objectives - leaving **45%** of their water wells in need of major repairs.  

My goal with this project is to help **The Tanzania Commission for Water** and the director of this agency with identifying which wells need to be repaired currently, while also prediciting on which of these wells will need to be repaired in the future in order to maintain the cleanliness and safety of the water that is supplied to the Tanzania population.
